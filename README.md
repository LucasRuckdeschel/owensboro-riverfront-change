# Downtown and Riverfront in Owensboro, KY
## Continued Development and Restoration of a Historic Area

The downtown and riverfront districts in Owensboro, KY, have been in constant change for almost twenty years. Once the center for commercial and industrial distribution along this stretch of the Ohio River, Owensboro's oldest area had become derelict by the turn of the 21st century. Thus, a large effort to revitalize this part of town has been underway since the early 2000's.

*The Owensboro Convention center is a uniquely designed building with extreme relief due to the shape of the roof. The surveys conducted by KYFromAbove are aerial, and the LIDAR data they collect is from a vertical perspective. Thus, buildings with no discernible external features, like the Owensboro Convention Center, can appear as floating platforms in a point cloud, which is a phenomenon I wanted to include in my map.*
