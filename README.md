A look into the changes to the downtown and riverfront area of Owensboro, KY between 2013 and 2022.
# Downtown and Riverfront in Owensboro, KY
## Continued Development and Restoration of a Historic Area

The downtown and riverfront districts in Owensboro, KY, have been in constant change for almost twenty years. Once the center for commercial and industrial distribution along this stretch of the Ohio River, Owensboro's oldest area had become derelict by the turn of the 21st century. Thus, a large effort to revitalize this part of town has been underway since the early 2000's.

## General Changes to the Riverfront Area

Although the location I chose for the point clouds in this project does not show drastic change over the last ten years, it is a significant area for me because Owensboro is my hometown and I have been able to witness the construction and development firsthand. Pictured in deep blue are a few recent structures; an apartment complex and a parking garage. Additionally, blue is seen in the majority of trees in the map, which indicates their growth over the last ten years. The red in the image comes almost entirely from the demolition of old buildings and structures that have since been replaced by new offices and development in downtown Owensboro. 

## What is the floating platform in the foreground?

*The Owensboro Convention center is a uniquely designed building with extreme relief due to the shape of the roof. The surveys conducted by KYFromAbove are aerial, and the LIDAR data they collect is from a vertical perspective. Thus, buildings with no discernible external features, like the Owensboro Convention Center, can appear as floating platforms in a point cloud, which is a phenomenon I wanted to include in my map.*
